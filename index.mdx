## What's Inside

- **Authentication** – Complete JWT and OAuth 2.0 flows with token refresh and rotation.
- **Case APIs** – Create cases (`POST /cases`), update cases by ID (`PUT /cases/{id}`), re-refer cases (`POST /cases/{id}/re-refer`), and list cases with filtering.
- **Directory APIs** – Get firms (`GET /firms`), jurisdictions (`GET /firms/jurisdictions`), and case types (`GET /firms/case-types`).
- **Routing** – Evaluate routing rules (`POST /routing/evaluate-api`) to automate firm suggestions.
- **Error Handling** – Consistent response schemas and rate-limit headers.
