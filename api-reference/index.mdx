## API Reference

This section is powered directly by the OpenAPI schema in `api-reference/openapi.yml`, so every endpoint, request schema, response schema, and status code shown here is generated from the source of truth.

### What is covered

- 58 paths and 74 operations in the current OpenAPI schema.
- Authentication, users, firms, cases, status updates, documents, CSV import, integrations, analytics, routing, and demo seed endpoints.
- Shared request/response schemas and standardized error envelopes used across the API.

### Base URLs

- Production: `https://api.casexchange.com/api/v1`
- Proxied/local docs setups: `/api/v1`

<Note>
  If "Try It" requests fail with a `404`, confirm the selected server in the endpoint page matches your environment and that the docs host is configured to proxy `/api/v1` when using the relative server.
</Note>

### Authentication

Most endpoints require a bearer token (`bearerAuth`).

Use this sequence for JWT-based integrations:

1. `POST /auth/login`
2. `GET /auth/me`
3. `POST /auth/refresh-session` (when the access token expires)
4. Continue requests with `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`

See:

- `/api-reference/examples` for end-to-end request examples
- `/api-reference/error-handling` for auth failure troubleshooting

### Response conventions

Most JSON responses use a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": null,
  "data": {}
}
```

List endpoints usually return pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 124,
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 7
  }
}
```

### How to navigate the autogenerated endpoints

- Use the API Reference tab sections generated from OpenAPI tags.
- Open any endpoint page to inspect required headers, path/query params, request body schema, and documented responses.
- Compare `200/201` schemas with shared `400/401/403/404/409` error examples to implement reliable client behavior.
