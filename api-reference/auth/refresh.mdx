```http
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh-session
Authorization: Bearer <optional>
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Request

No body is required when using refresh cookies. For server-to-server integrations, include a refresh token explicitly.

```json
{}
```

## Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Session refreshed successfully"
}
```

Notes:

- Refresh tokens are typically stored as HttpOnly cookies.
- Server-to-server workflows can provide a refresh token in the request body if approved by support.
- Rotate refresh tokens on a schedule to reduce exposure.
